Hello! We're team 3 from Professional Development in Open Project made up of developers and designers. We're working on a hackathon project to showcase all of the work we do throughout the semester. This project aims to demonstrate our learning journey and achievements, covering technical skills in front-end development and design thinking. We're developing ourselves professionally through topics including React, Figma, HTML, Javascript and more!
